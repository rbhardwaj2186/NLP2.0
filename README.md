# NLP Preprocessing with NLTK

This repository contains code and examples for preprocessing tweets using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The goal is to prepare raw tweet data for sentiment analysis by cleaning and formatting the text.

## Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is essential for understanding and analyzing human language. Preprocessing is a critical step in any NLP project, helping to clean and structure the data before feeding it into machine learning algorithms. This repository covers the key preprocessing steps using NLTK, including:

- Tokenization
- Lowercasing
- Removing stop words and punctuation
- Stemming

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:
